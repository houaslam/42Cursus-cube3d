c_h.y = (floor(player.y / 64) * 64) + 64
c_h.x = player.x + Tan(alpha)*(c_h.y - player.y)

d_h.y = 64 (Since we travel in the positive y direction)
d_h.x = 64 * Tan(alpha)

c_v.x = (floor(player.x / 64) * 64) - 64
c_v.y = player.y + (c_v.x - player.x) / Tan(alpha)

d_v.x = 64 (Since we travel in the positive x direction)
d_v.y = 64 / Tan(alpha)
